# (Unofficial) ANU Golang Workshop

A workshop run at the Australian National University, designed for second-year computer science students. This covers some high-level ideas in Go, and provides some exercises to work on.

## Setup

[First, install Go.](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Secondly, set up an IDE of your choice. I personally use Visual Studio Code with the [Golang extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go).

Another good option is [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/), an IDE built by Jetbrains. If you've used IntelliJ IDEA before (such as in COMP1110), this should be familiar to you.
